# Changelog

All notable changes to Tempo are documented in this file.

## [4.8.10] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- Anonymous app-health statistics, so crashes and broken features can actually be found and fixed. They cover crashes, errors, which screens and features are used, and whether background music detection is alive. Counts are sent as ranges rather than exact figures, and there is no account, no device identifier, and never any track, artist or listening history. On by default, off in one tap at **Settings → Your Data**, and completely inert in any build compiled from source.
- **Settings → Your Data → Data & diagnostics**, one screen answering both data questions. "What we collect" lists every event Tempo can send and the exact data attached to each one; the diagnostics report is a user-initiated summary of how Tempo is running on your device — versions, library counts, music detection health and background work. Both stay collapsed until opened, and neither leaves your device unless you choose to share it, which is why the report can be far more detailed than the anonymous statistics and why it is the most useful thing to attach to a bug report.
- Configurable tracking rules in the Supported apps screen: "Count a listen after" (1 second to 10 minutes, default 25 seconds), a default maximum music duration (default 20 minutes) with a per-app override or no limit, and a content-exceptions list that forces matching media to always count as music or always be excluded as video/non-music.
- History entries gained "Always music" and "Video / non-music" actions per track and per artist. Corrections apply to matching history in place without deleting the track, and a more specific Always Music exception survives a later artist-wide correction.

### Changed
- Badge star tiers rebalanced so no badge is effectively impossible. Star 5 used to be a fixed 50× the unlock threshold for every badge, which scaled the largest badges into nonsense: *Legendary* (10,000 plays) needed 500,000 plays (~45 years) and *The Centennial* (Level 100) needed Level 5,000 (~400 years) for five stars. Each badge now has its own explicit, reachable five-star target — interpolated smoothly across the intermediate tiers — capping the hardest MYTHIC badge at roughly two years of dedicated listening while leaving ★1 unlocks untouched. Existing users can only keep or gain stars, never lose one.
- Daily challenges stopped repeating the same family two days running and learned the user's schedule. The time challenge is now a 3-hour window around the typical first-listen hour (Early Bird, Prime Time, or Night Owl, with a 7–10 AM fallback), discovery targets scale with past discovery instead of sitting at the cap, and XP rewards are fixed per date so regenerating a day keeps the same payout.
- The privacy policy now describes app-health reporting in full, including that a coarse country/region is derived from the request IP, and that the app never sends an identifier of any kind.

### Fixed
- Anonymous app-health statistics never being uploaded: the upload worker's first run was scheduled a full interval ahead (5 hours for the 6-hour cadence), and there was no one-shot upload anywhere, so a fresh install showed an empty dashboard until that window elapsed. Collection now triggers an immediate upload the moment the notice makes reporting legal, and on every app start.
- Statistics uploads being limited to unmetered networks, which silenced reporting for anyone on mobile data only — and because events expire after 24 hours, a user who was never on Wi-Fi sent nothing at all. Uploads now use any available connection; the payload is a few hundred bytes per event and roughly 16 KB on a busy day.
- The Home notice explaining anonymous app-health reporting removing itself in the frame it appeared: it marked itself as seen on first composition, and visibility was driven by that same flag. It now stays on screen until acknowledged or turned off, so the opt-out beside it is actually reachable.
- YouTube Music Takeout imports mis-reading the newer watch-history layout: the first subtitle — the release link literally named "Release" — was stored as the artist for hundreds of songs (making "Release" a top-3 artist), albums were lost ("unknown"), and plays split across duplicate track rows so all-time counts stayed wrong. Artists and albums are now resolved by link role (channel URLs vs. playlist/release URLs) with a `details` fallback, and placeholder labels ("Release", "Song", "Playlist", etc.) can never be stored as an artist.
- Repairs for installs already affected by the "Release" artifact: re-importing the same Takeout ZIP now detects those rows, fixes their artist/album in place (or merges them into the correct-artist track row), re-queues them for album/artwork/genre enrichment, and reports the count as "Tracks repaired" in the import summary. Already-imported plays are deduplicated by content fingerprint, so nothing is double-counted.
- Split Artist silently doing nothing when the only group's default target name resolved to the source artist itself: the split now fails with a clear message instead of reporting a success with zero moves, and the source artist's name is no longer pre-filled as the move target.
- Manual song merges keeping the bogus artist when merging into a placeholder-artist row (e.g. the "Release" copy): the surviving track now adopts the source track's real artist and is re-linked through the artist pipeline so stats, details, and junction rows all follow.
- Albums showing no cover art in rankings, artist pages and album search even though their songs had artwork. The album-grouped stats queries read the art column without an aggregate, so SQLite resolved it from an arbitrary song in the group — an album whose first-scanned song had no art reported none, and an album whose first-scanned song had only local art hid the richer online cover. Artwork is now aggregated across the album, preferring the enriched URL over the on-device fallback.
- Album details showing a blank cover while its own track list showed art, for albums that were never enriched at album level (imports, Takeout, desktop scrobbles). The header now falls back to a cover from the album's songs, preferring an online URL over a local file.
- Cover art extraction blocking the UI thread on every new track: the bitmap downscale, JPEG encode and file write for the local fallback ran inline in the notification and MediaSession callbacks, which could stutter or ANR when skipping tracks quickly. That work now runs off the main thread.
- Duplicate daily challenges double-counting XP when the midnight worker and the Profile screen generated the same day at once. Generation now runs in one transaction against a unique (challenge_id, date) index, and migration 54 dedupes existing rows keeping the most-progressed copy.
- Pruning challenges older than 90 days subtracting their XP on the next recompute. Completed XP is now banked into user_level before deletion, so total XP and level survive pruning.
- Genre challenges miscounting progress: combos like "rock|||pop" counted as one genre (or only the first segment) and tags were ignored. Genre progress now splits combos, falls back to tags, and "new genres" only counts genres never heard before today.
- Explore-artist and explore-genre challenge IDs used String.hashCode and could collide, merging two artists into one row. IDs are now stable slugs, so different names can no longer share a challenge.

## [4.8.7] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- Album merge tool in the album details menu to consolidate split albums, duplicate track history, and scrobble archives into a single target album.
- Fullscreen level-up and badge celebration screens with particle effects and exportable achievement share cards.
- Setting to toggle gamification on or off, hiding levels, badges, and XP counters across the app.
- Listening overview sheet on the home screen with hourly listening distribution charts, period comparisons, and direct share export.
- Top search drawer on the rankings screen for filtering artists, albums, and tracks in place.
- Option to pause playback tracking when device battery drops below 20%.

### Changed
- Reworked share themes into six dedicated visual styles (Midnight, Glass, ASCII, Minimum, Daylight, and Glitch), including artwork-derived motion blur, scanlines, and RGB splits for Glitch.
- Updated the album details screen layout to match the artist view, replacing the 2x2 stat grid with a hero play count and reformatting track rows with track numbers and play counts.
- Redesigned the history screen header with a persistent search bar and a filter sheet for custom time ranges and playback sources.
- Prefetched history pages four items before the end of the list to prevent scrolling hitches.
- Offloaded profile unique artist calculations to IO threads and precomputed badge star progress.

### Fixed
- Switched Google Drive sign-in to Credential Manager to resolve authentication hangs and missing account states.
- Isolated periodic Google Drive backup worker runs across retries to prevent overlapping jobs and state corruption.
- Fixed background backup restore cancellation issues by preserving active backup identity and manual worker triggers.
- Restricted post-restore bulk image pre-caching to known music CDN domains to prevent arbitrary background network requests from untrusted backup archives.
- Restricted restored profile image paths strictly to verified internal storage URIs, dropping arbitrary schemes from backup data.
- Constrained share theme background layers to card boundaries to stop visual overflow in export previews.

## [4.8.3] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- Live search in the ranking screen with debounced SQL and in-memory filtering, showing global rank badges for matched tracks, artists, and albums.
- Split Artist tool in the artist details menu to move misassigned tracks to a new or existing artist profile.
- Reworked share theme palette with six themes (Midnight, Rose, Aurora, Mono, Daylight, and Ocean) featuring theme-specific geometry across stats, track, and artist export cards.
- Russian and Hungarian in-app language selections.
- Minimum playback threshold for Personal Favorite tags with human-readable reason tags.

### Fixed
- Google Drive backup crash (`Export failed: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.util.List`) by making the export JSON codec tolerate malformed `List<String>` data (`Artist.genres`, `EnrichedMetadata.tags/.genres`) and recover `|||`-delimited raw strings instead of aborting the whole export; restore likewise recovers bare-string values where a JSON array is expected instead of failing with `Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was STRING`.
- Legacy list-column corruption at its source: rows written by older builds stored `artists.genres` and `enriched_metadata.tags/.genres` as JSON-array text (e.g. `["jazz", "cool jazz"]`), which read back as a single garbage element. The Room converter now repairs such values on read and canonicalizes on write, a one-time `ListColumnRepairService` rewrites the affected rows in place on first launch, and genre inference in the enrichment worker understands both storage generations.
- Profile screen crash caused by measuring intrinsic constraints on `SubcomposeLayout`.
- Artist name collapse for Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic, Indic, and Thai scripts by applying Unicode NFKC normalization, script-aware diacritic folding, and an automated background repair.
- Schema 52 migration crash when upgrading from the public 4.8.2 build, supported by an automated pre-migration database file snapshot.
- YouTube Music Takeout import failure on non-English history file names (such as `histórico de músicas ouvidas.json`) and stripped localized "Watched" prefixes from imported track titles.
- Foreground service crashes on Android 13+ by enforcing `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` on battery broadcast receivers and validating notification channel creation before calling `startForeground`.
- Play loss during clean service shutdowns or OEM background kills by executing shutdown flushes synchronously and persisting pending events to durable storage.
- Permanent listener disablement caused by incomplete process restarts.
- Memory exceptions (TransactionTooLarge / OOM) caused by large cover art by downsampling bitmaps before database writes.
- Google Drive backup 403 authorization failures by verifying `drive.file` scope before saving tokens and prompting re-authentication.
- Parsing error for legacy Spotify takeout timestamps formatted without seconds (`yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`).
- Accumulation caps on looped playback to match the 3x track duration limit.
- Browser extension listen time calculation errors on YouTube Music caused by non-finite duration properties.
- Browser extension background play session loss during service worker hibernation.
- Browser extension sync retries hammering the device by classifying error types, respecting `Retry-After` headers, and applying exponential backoff.
- Firefox extension rejection caused by duplicate background script declarations in `manifest.json`.

### Changed
- Artist renames now propagate through individual track credits, multi-artist strings, and cached stats in a single transaction.
- Daily challenge progress now updates via the background gamification worker rather than requiring a profile screen launch.
- Metadata enrichment workers now settle all items to terminal states (`ENRICHED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `SKIPPED`) to prevent infinite retry loops.
- Desktop Satellite battery receiver thread no longer uses blocking calls.
