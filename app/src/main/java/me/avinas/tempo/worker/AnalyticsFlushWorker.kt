/**
 * Uploads buffered anonymous app-health events.
 *
 * Any working connection is enough: the whole payload is a few hundred bytes per event and
 * ~16 KB on a busy day, so holding it back for Wi-Fi would suppress reporting for the
 * majority of users who are on mobile data only. The constraint is deliberately `CONNECTED`
 * rather than `UNMETERED` for that reason — see docs/ANALYTICS.md.
 *
 * Events older than 24h are rejected by the ingest API and dropped by the queue, so this
 * running rarely costs nothing but latency.
